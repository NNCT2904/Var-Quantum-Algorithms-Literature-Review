\section{Overview}
In this paper, we review the Quantum Neural Networks in relation with Variational Quantum Algorithms, their structures and mathematics underneath. 
We aim to explore their gaps of study, especially the factors that would lead to the problem of Barren Plateaus.
Then, we review and compare some methods to counter or minimise the Barren Plateaus phenomenal by addressing those factors.

We strongly recommend readers to have a foundation knowledge in Quantum Computing, Linear Algebra and Machine Learning.

In general, The paper \cite{wangNoiseinducedBarrenPlateaus2021} by Samson Wang et al. shows that Barren Plateaus can be noise induced, which means that the quantum hardware assumes certain noise models, making it challenging to train a model. 
BP also can be circuit induced \cite{mccleanBarrenPlateausQuantum2018}, as a result of the circuit design and random initialization parameters.
There are methods to avoid circuit inducted BP studied in \cite{pesahAbsenceBarrenPlateaus2021, cerezoCostFunctionDependent2021,skolikLayerwiseLearningQuantum2021}.
The below sections discuss the factors that lead to circuit inducted BP and some attempts to resolve the issue.
