\section{Overview}

Many Quantum Machine Learning models suffer from the unsolvability Barren Plateaus \cite{zhaoReviewQuantumNeural2021} that prevent the growth of circuit depth and lead the trainable parameters to a dead end.

The paper \cite{wangNoiseinducedBarrenPlateaus2021} by Samson Wang et al. shows that Barren Plateaus can be noise inducted, which means that the quantum hardware assumes certain noise models, which makes it challenging to train a model. 
BP also can be circuit inducted \cite{mccleanBarrenPlateausQuantum2018}, which relates to the chosen model and random initialization parameters.
There are methods to avoid circuit inducted BP studied in \cite{pesahAbsenceBarrenPlateaus2021, cerezoCostFunctionDependent2021,skolikLayerwiseLearningQuantum2021}.
The below sections discuss the factors that lead to circuit inducted BP and some attempts to resolve the issue.
