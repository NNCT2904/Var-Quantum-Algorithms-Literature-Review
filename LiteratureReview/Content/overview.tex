\section{Overview}
In this paper, we review the Quantum Neural Networks in relation with Variational Quantum Algorithms, their structures and mathematics underneath.

The paper \cite{wangNoiseinducedBarrenPlateaus2021} by Samson Wang et al. shows that Barren Plateaus can be noise induced, which means that the quantum hardware assumes certain noise models, making it challenging to train a model. 
BP also can be circuit induced \cite{mccleanBarrenPlateausQuantum2018}, as a result of the circuit design and random initialization parameters.
There are methods to avoid circuit inducted BP studied in \cite{pesahAbsenceBarrenPlateaus2021, cerezoCostFunctionDependent2021,skolikLayerwiseLearningQuantum2021}.
The below sections discuss the factors that lead to circuit inducted BP and some attempts to resolve the issue.
