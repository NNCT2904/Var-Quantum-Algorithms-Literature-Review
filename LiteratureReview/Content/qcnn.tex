\todo{Addressing BP by not seeing it as a problem.}

The study of BP in Quantum Convolutional Neural Network \cite{pesahAbsenceBarrenPlateaus2021} has discovered that the variance of gradient vanishes no faster than polynomially, suggesting that there is no BP in QCNN. Thus, trainability is guaranteed for QCNN under random initialization.
