\subsection{Method: Layerwise Learning}

\todo{Addressing circuit depth and random parameters}

Skolik et al. investigated a layerwise learning strategy for parameterized quantum circuits in \cite{skolikLayerwiseLearningQuantum2021}. 
By starting the training with a shallow circuit, the model can mitigate the random initialization in \cite{mccleanBarrenPlateausQuantum2018}, the circuit structure and the number of parameters is extended while training the circuit. This approach can avoid the initialization on a plateau and reduce the chance of meeting a plateau during training.
