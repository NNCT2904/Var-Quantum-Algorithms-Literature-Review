\subsection{Method: shallow circuit, local cost function}

Cerezo et al. has demonstrated in \cite{cerezoCostFunctionDependent2021} that if a local cost function is used, then there is a lower bound for the variants of the gradients that depends on the number of qubits and some configurations of the circuit.
