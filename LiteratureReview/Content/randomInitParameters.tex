\subsection{Addressing Random initialization parameters}

\subsubsection{Layerwise learning for quantum neural networks \texorpdfstring{\cite{skolikLayerwiseLearningQuantum2021}}{}}
The algorithm in \cite{skolikLayerwiseLearningQuantum2021} starts with training a shallow circuit to its best, then extends the circuit and uses the best parameter achieved in the previous step for the newly extended circuit. 
Note that only the new parameters are allowed to vary while the previous parameters are frozen.
Thus, the randomness is contained to only shallow sub-circuits in phase one during the whole routine, and minimize the probability of meeting a plateau during the process.
