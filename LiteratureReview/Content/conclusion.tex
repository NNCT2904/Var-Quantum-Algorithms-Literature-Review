\subsection{Conclusion}
In this literature review, we went through the definition of QNN and VQA to point out the challenging Barren Plateaus phenomenon. 
Some studies have attempted to address this issue, but the problem has not been entirely resolved.
We have selected three methods directly related to the main factors that lead to this phenomenon: the initialization process the circuit depth and the number of qubits.
Finally, we compactly discuss the three methods by comparing their properties, pros and cons.
This literature review also suggests that an empirical study is required to identify the best strategies for particular situations.
