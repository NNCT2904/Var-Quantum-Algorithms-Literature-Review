\section{Conclusion}
In this literature review, we went through the definition of QNN and VQA to point out the challenging Barren Plateaus phenomenon. 
Some studies have attempted to address this issue, but the problem has not been entirely resolved.
We have selected three methods directly related to the main factors that lead to this phenomenon: the initialization process and the circuit depth.
Finally, we discuss the three methods compactly by comparing their properties, pro and cons.
