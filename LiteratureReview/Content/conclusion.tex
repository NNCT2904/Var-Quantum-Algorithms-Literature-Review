\subsection{Conclusion}
In this literature review, we discussed definitions of QNN and VQA quantum machine learning models, and we pointed out the challenge of their training due to the emergence of barren plateaus in their training, which was also explained at a significant depth.
Some previous studies have attempted to address this issue, but the barren plateaus problem has not been fully resolved.
We have selected three methods of dealing with barren plateaus.
Subsequently, we directly related each of the methods to the principal factors responsible for the emergence of barren plateaus: the initialisation process, the circuit depth, and the number of qubits.
Finally, we concisely discussed the three methods by comparing their properties, their pros and cons.
We suggest that an empirical study is required to identify the best method given particular situations.
