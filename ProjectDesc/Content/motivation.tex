\subsection{Motivation}
There exist some problems preventing effective QNN development as pointed out in section \ref{Background Section} and further discusses in section \ref{Barren Plateaus section}, one of them is the emergence of Barren Plateaus in the expectation landscape during training.
Luckily, several previous studies have already addressed this problem \cite{cerezoCostFunctionDependent2021,skolikLayerwiseLearningQuantum2021,grantInitializationStrategyAddressing2019}.
In this study, we bring together and compare those methods to identify the most suitable for use in different circumstances.
We also provide guidelines for mitigating or avoiding BP, with a view to make VQAs more versatile in solving practical problems in an optimal fashion.
