\subsection{Motivation}
There are indeed some problems with QNN training, as pointed out in section \ref{Background Section}, namely the Barren Plateaus phenomenon.
Luckily, some studies addressed the problem: \cite{pesahAbsenceBarrenPlateaus2021,pattiEntanglementDevisedBarren2021,liuParameterInitializationMethod2021}.S
We bring together those methods to identify the most suitable for different circumstances.
We also give a reference and guidelines for mitigating or avoiding BP, and therefore, VQAs can solve more practical problems. 
This project provides an approach to Quantum Algorithms for Machine Learning and Computer scientists.
