\subsection{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Some basic background for Quantum Computing, VQA and QNN;
    \item Define the BP problem and the causes that would lead to this phenomenon: \cite{wangNoiseinducedBarrenPlateaus2021,zhaoAnalyzingBarrenPlateau2021};
    \item Investigate several methods to mitigate or avoid BP: \cite{pesahAbsenceBarrenPlateaus2021, pattiEntanglementDevisedBarren2021,liuParameterInitializationMethod2021};
    \item Comparison of their advantage/disadvantage to identify the best approach;
    \item Conclude the research with summary and open issues.
\end{enumerate}
