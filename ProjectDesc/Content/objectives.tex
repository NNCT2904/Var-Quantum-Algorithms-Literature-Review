\subsection{Objectives}
To answer the above research question, it will be necessary to meet the following research objectives:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Provide the background information for quantum computing, VQA and QNN, which enables definition of the research question (completed, see \ref{Background Section});
%     \item Define the BP problem and the causes that would lead to this phenomenon \cite{wangNoiseinducedBarrenPlateaus2021,zhaoAnalyzingBarrenPlateau2021} (completed, see \ref{Problem Section});
%     \item Investigate several methods to mitigate or avoid BP \cite{pesahAbsenceBarrenPlateaus2021, pattiEntanglementDevisedBarren2021,liuParameterInitializationMethod2021};
%     \item Compare advantages and disadvantages of the identified methods to identify the most appropriate approaches in different circumstances;
%     \item Conclude the research with summary and open issues still remaining for the future research.
% \end{enumerate}
