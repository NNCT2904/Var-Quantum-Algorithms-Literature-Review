Quantum Computing is a new and exciting area of Science, which intersects Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science.
Quantum algorithms are known to solve problems, which until recently have been considered unsolvable classically due to their inherent complexity. 
Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) is a hybrid classical-quantum technique that can produce variational (or parametrised) circuits, which act as templates for circuit generation. 
VQA adopted the machine learning technique such that the quantum hardware is used to estimate the cost function gradient, while using classical optimization algorithms to train the quantum circuit.
