\subsection{Motivation}
\todo{We may need to work on these more, e.g. if you work on feature maps the motivation may be to provide a set of guidelines for the creation of feature maps suitable for QNNs and a given data set, if it is about barren plateaus, perhaps it is about finding a QNN architecture which eliminates barren plateaus}

We give a reference and guidelines for mitigating or avoid Barren Plateaus phenomenon, and therefore, VQAs can solve more practical problems. This projects also provide an approach to Quantum Algorithms for Machine Learning and Computer scientists.
