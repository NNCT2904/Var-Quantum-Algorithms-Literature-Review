\subsection{The problem}
\todo{Is this problem sufficient? According to several papers, this problem is worth studying/investigating, and I think it is quite enough for the scope of eight months. However, I am an amateur, and I might underestimate the difficulty. What is your opinion, professor?}

For this research project, we are interested in the problem "How to mitigate or avoid the QNN development in the VQA circuit construction approach." The context is given as in section \ref{Background Section}.
