\subsection{Artefact Development Summary T1-2021}
We have implemented one method of dealing with barren plateau by altering the depth and the cost function aspects of the ansatz.
Due to the time constrain, these experiments are within the scope of a \textit{minimum viable artefact}.
The experiments have produced the results as the slopes of the gradients for a range of qubits.
The results indicate that the variances of the gradient can be stable if we set a limit on the length of circuit, as well as the measurement for qubits.

With this artefact, we have partly addressed the research design in Section \ref{Research Design section}, by exploring different types of ansatzes and comparing the ther gradient decay rate with two methods.
This artefact contributes the ansatz component, and implementation of two methods to the final artefact.

Compared to the final artefact described in Section \ref{Data Collecting Section}, we expect to implement the rest of the three methods, namely \textit{layerwise learning} and \textit{identity blocks}.
Moreover, one shortcomming of the current artefact version is that we have not yet to implement a problem for the QNN model to optimise.
We have known that the method in the notebook can produce high variance values, however, it does not mean the optimization is going in a right direction, it can still stuck in a local minimum, or the error landscape is random, thus the model cannot converge to the global minimum - the answer.
Moreover, these experiments are conducted in an emulated environment without noise, or decoherence, or faulties.
The actual quantum device will not have such characteristics.
Thus, this experiment is not reflecting the real-life sittuation.
