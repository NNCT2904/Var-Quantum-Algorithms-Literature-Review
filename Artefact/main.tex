\section{Artefact Development Report (draft)}
\begin{todolist}
    \item[\done] Discussion on artefact developed (so far) and evaluation of the artefact (if any);
    \item[\done] Details of data collected, experimental procedure;
    \item Lessons learned in the sprint (?);
    \item[\done] Results of the artefact analysis;
\end{todolist}

Notes from Prof.

\begin{todolist}
    \item[\done] How gradient variance is being calculated (formula)
    \item[\done] How do we know that high variance does not simply mean that your gradient function is not just noise?
    \item Does it converge eventually?
    \item Can you verify that the gradient descent results in a solution?
\end{todolist}
