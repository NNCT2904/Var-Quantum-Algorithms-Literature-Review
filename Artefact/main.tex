\section{Artefact Development Report - T1 2022 (draft)}
\almarginpar{We need some introduction to the section 4 explaining its purpose and its}
\almarginpar{Be clear from above design discussion what the artefact development was to achieve and what part of it the minimum artefact satisfies}
\begin{todolist}
    \item[\done] Discussion on artefact developed (so far) and evaluation of the artefact (if any);
    \item[\done] Details of data collected, experimental procedure;
    \item Lessons learned in the sprint (?);
    \item[\done] Results of the artefact analysis;
\end{todolist}

Notes from Prof.

\begin{todolist}
    \item[\done] How gradient variance is being calculated (formula)
    \item[\done] How do we know that high variance does not simply mean that your gradient function is not just noise (for future works)?
    \item Does it converge eventually (for future works)?
    \item Can you verify that the gradient descent results in a solution (for future works)?
