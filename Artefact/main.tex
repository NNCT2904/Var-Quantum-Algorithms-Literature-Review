\section{Artefact Development Report}\label{Minimum Artefact section}

In this section, we describe the progress on the artefact development, the detail and context for the experiments are given as Section \ref{Research Design section}.
We address the process (see Section \ref{Research Activities section}) by implementing a series of exploratory experiments.
The artefact is a Python notebook file containing Python scripts to run the experiment.
We run the notebook with IBM Quantum Experience, as it provides online services for running and simulating quantum hardware.
We use the hardware noise sample from the device \emph{ibm\_perth} to configure our simulator to achieve a most accurate to that of a real quantum neural network training scenario.

We have chosen the ansatz \emph{Real Amplitude} and a custom ansatz (see Section \ref{Sec: Creating Ansatzes}) as the objects of study.
The four treatments applied to these ansatzes are further discussed in Section \ref{Sec: Treatments for ansatzes} (see Table \ref{implementation of methods table} and Figure \ref{Research Activities Figure}).
We summarise the experiment results from Section \ref{Result section} in Table \ref{Tab: Experiment Phase 1 Res} and \ref{Tab: Experiment Phase 2 Res}.
