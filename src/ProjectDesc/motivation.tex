\subsection{Motivation}
\todo{We may need to work on these more, e.g. if you work on feature maps the motivation may be to provide a set of guidelines for the creation of feature maps suitable for QNNs and a given data set, if it is about barren plateaus, perhaps it is about finding a QNN architecture which eliminates barren plateaus}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Learning ML with Quantum computer;
    \item This research also provides an approach to Quantum algorithms for ML engineers, and Computer science;
    \item Some useful applications with QNN:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Can work with early state of quantum computers (limited Qbit number and circuit depth);
        \item Error Correction is not necessary.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Prove that VQAs (and QNN) can still be a promising field even for fault-tolerant Quantum computers in the future.
    \item \st{For my Bachelor of IT Hons degree ofc.}
\end{enumerate}
