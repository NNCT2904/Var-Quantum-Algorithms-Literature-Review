\subsection{The problem}
Here are some topics (need to pick one):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implementation of Binary image classification with objects of distinct classes $A$ and $B$. For example: Cats and Dogs.
    \item Feature maps of high-order in relation with training capability as addressed in \cite{abbasPowerQuantumNeural2021}.
    \item The Barren Plateaus in QNN circuit training and how to avoid/deal with them
\end{enumerate}
\todo{2 and 3 are interesting, but you ideally need to formulate the problem into a question, e.g. "How..."}
Topics other than QNN:

Solving Max2Xor / knapsack / max-cut with QAOA.
