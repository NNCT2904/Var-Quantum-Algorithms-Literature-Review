\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pick a name (I haven't),
    \item Run through Classical Machine Learning (briefly),
    \item From Classical Machine Learning to VQA (model, feature map, anzats, cost function, optimizers, etc.),
    \item Practice QNN: Image classification in python (Qiskit), maybe classifying animals, cats and mouses, using "Supervised learning" or other settings,
    \item Compare the performance to classical equivalent;
    \item Conclude the research with motivation and applications.
\end{enumerate}
