\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pick a name (Due this weekend),
    \item Run through Classical Machine Learning (briefly),
    \item Hypothesis for QNN: From Classical Machine Learning to VQA (model, feature map, anzats, cost function, optimizers, etc.), a model that maps objects of distinct classes to binary output like: $A \to 0$ and $B \to 1$.
    \item Practice QNN: Image classification in python (Qiskit), maybe classifying animals, cats and mouses, using "Supervised learning" or any other settings. This step test the model if not work then need to alter the hypothesis.
    \item Conclude the research with summary, motivation and applications.
\end{enumerate}

Hypothesis for Feature maps and QCNN circuit training: A feature is an individual measurable property (characteristic in short) of a class of objects. A \textit{Feature map} is related to dimensionality reduction, it re-represent data in different space
