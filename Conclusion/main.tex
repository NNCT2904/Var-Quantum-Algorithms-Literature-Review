\section{Conclusion T1-2021}
*** I'm writing this section but the timee is tight, will need to address it after the research design ***

In future works, we expect to implement the rest of the three methods, namely \textit{layerwise learning} and \textit{identity blocks}.
Moreover, one shortcomming of the current artefact version is that we have not yet to implement a problem for the QNN model to optimise.
We have known that the method in the notebook can produce high variance values, however, it does not mean the optimization is going in a right direction, it can still stuck in a local minimum, or the error landscape is random, thus the model cannot converge to the global minimum - the answer.
Moreover, these experiments are conducted in an emulated environment without noise, or decoherence, or faulties.
The actual quantum device will not have such characteristics.
Thus, this experiment is not reflecting the real-life sittuation.
We will cover these issues in T2-2022.
