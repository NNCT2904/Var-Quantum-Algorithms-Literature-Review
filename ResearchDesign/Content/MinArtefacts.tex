\section{Minimum Artefact and Future Works}

The success conditions of the experiment, as discussed, contains the QNN model, the three implementations, the data generated and a guideline to identify which methods to be used in different occasion.
However, the time span for experiment of the unit is limited to one week, we believe that we can deliver a minimum viable artefact as a single python script that contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A QNN ansatz that possesses Barren Plateaus;
    \item Implementation of three methods as discussed in the literature review;
    \item Verify the existence of Barren Plateaus for each method above, by calculating the variances of their gradients.
\end{itemize}

This artefact outcome will not answer the research question completely. 
However, it covers half of the experiment and ensure that the outcome is ready for future works.
