\section{Minimum Artefact and Future Works}

The success conditions of the experiment, as discussed, contains the QNN model, the three implementations, the data generated and a guideline to identify which methods to be used on different occasion.
However, the time for the experiment of the unit is limited to one week. We believe that we can deliver a minimum viable artefact as a single python script that contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A QNN ansatz that possesses Barren Plateaus;
    \item Implementation of three methods as discussed in the literature review;
    \item Verify the existence of Barren Plateaus for each method above by calculating the variances of their gradients.
\end{itemize}

This artefact outcome will not answer the research question completely. 
However, it covers the first half of the experiment and ensures that the outcome is ready to advance to the next steps.
We shall leave it for the second half of the experiment for future works.
