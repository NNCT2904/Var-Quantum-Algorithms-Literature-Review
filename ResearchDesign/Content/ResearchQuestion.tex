\section{Research Question and Motivation}
For this research project, we are interested in the problem "How to mitigate or avoid Barren Plateaus (BP) in the QNN development in the VQA circuit construction approach."

There are indeed some problems with QNN training, as pointed out in Project Description and Literature review, namely the Barren Plateaus phenomenon.
Luckily, some studies have addressed the problem: \cite{pesahAbsenceBarrenPlateaus2021,pattiEntanglementDevisedBarren2021,liuParameterInitializationMethod2021}.
We bring together those methods to identify the most suitable for different circumstances.
We also give a reference and guidelines for mitigating or avoiding BP, and therefore, VQAs can solve more practical problems.
