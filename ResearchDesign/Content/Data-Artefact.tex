\subsection{Data Collecting Method and Artefacts Development}
\label{Data Collecting Section}
Here we discuss our method of collecting data from a series of experiments.
We implement the artefact as a Python Notebook that includes all experiment activities and results.
The notebook will require some pre-installed resources to execute (refer to Section \ref{Resources section} for further detail).
As we are conducting experiments on quantum circuits, quantum hardware is also required.
The notebook will be configured to communicate with an IBM quantum device.

\subsubsection{Success Condition}
The experiment will be concluded when these conditions are met:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We have ansatzes that can produce barren plateaus;
    \item The methods are implemented as Python scripts and ready for demonstration;
    \item The ansatzes are implemented as QNN models to solve problems.
    \item The outcomes are evaluated against the criteria.
\end{itemize}
