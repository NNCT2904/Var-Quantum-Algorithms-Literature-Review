\subsection{Criteria}
\label{Criteria section}
\almarginpar{Circuit "width" is just the number of qubits, so I removed it}We compare the results of each experimental outcome (as per Section \ref{Research Activities section}) using the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The number of qubits;
    \item The circuit depth;
    \item The quality of the solution;
    \item Loss value per iteration;
    \item The time required to execute the circuit.
\end{itemize}
