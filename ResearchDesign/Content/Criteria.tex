\subsection{Criteria}
\label{Criteria section}
We can compare the data of each outcome in from Section \ref{Research Activities section} with these criteria:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Does the model encounter barren plateaus for a large number of qubits?
    \item The quality of the solution;
    \item Loss values per iteration;
    \item The size of the circuit (circuit depth);
    \item The size of the qubit registry (circuit width);
    \item The time required to execute the circuit.
\end{itemize}
